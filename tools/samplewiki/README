Introduction
============

"samplewiki" is a simple C utility that will take an XML Wikipedia dump and
extract a random sample of pages from it.

Usage
=====

The script takes XML data on standard input and writes XML data on
standard output. Use a command line like this:

./samplewiki < enwiki-pages-articles.xml > enwiki-pages-articles.sample.xml

Use "make" to compile.

Other notes
===========

Change the PART define in source file to set the size of the sample.

For maximum speed of processing the code relies on the exact formatting of
the Wikipedia XML dumps. It won't work correctly if the amount of
whitespace in the XML changes.
