<h2> 1975–1985: Founding </h2>

Following the launch of the Altair 8800, Bill Gates called the creators of the new microcomputer, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), offering to demonstrate an implementation of the BASIC programming language for the system. After the demonstration, MITS agreed to distribute Altair BASIC.         Information for Students: Key Events In Microsoft History (doc)   . Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information .    Retrieved on 1 October , 2005 .

Gates left Harvard University, moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico where MITS was located, and founded Microsoft there.  The company&apos;s first international office was founded on November 1, 1978, in Japan, entitled &quot;ASCII Microsoft&quot; (now called &quot;Microsoft Japan&quot;).  On January 1, 1979, the company moved from Albuquerque to a new home in Bellevue, Washington.  Steve Ballmer joined the company on June 11, 1980, and later succeeded Bill Gates as CEO.

DOS (Disk Operating System) was the operating system that brought the company its first real success. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide a version of the CP/M operating system, which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer (PC). For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, which IBM renamed to PC-DOS. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned the IBM BIOS, and by aggressively marketing MS-DOS to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones, Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry.

Later in 1997, Internet Explorer 4.0 was released for both Mac OS and Windows, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.

The year 1998 was significant in Microsoft&apos;s history, with Bill Gates appointing Steve Ballmer as president of Microsoft but remaining as Chair and CEO himself.  The company released Windows 98, an update to Windows 95 that incorporated a number of Internet-focused features and support for new types of devices.  On April 3 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of United States v. Microsoft,  calling the company an &quot;abusive monopoly&quot;  and forcing the company to split into two separate units. Part of this ruling was later overturned by a federal appeals court, and eventually settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001.

In 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, the first version that encompassed the features of both its business and home product lines. XP introduced a new graphical user interface, the first such change since Windows 95.          Windows XP Professional Features    . Microsoft  ( August 25, 2004 )

To be more precise in tracking performance of each unit and delegating responsibility, Microsoft reorganized into seven core business groups—each an independent financial entity—in April 2002.

<h2> Platform Products and Services Division </h2>

<internal id="13752122">The current logo of Microsoft Windows, one of the company&apos;s best-known products.</internal>

This division produces Microsoft&apos;s flagship product, the Windows operating system. It has been produced in many versions, including Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows Me, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP and Windows Vista. Almost all IBM compatible personal computers come with Windows preinstalled. The current desktop version of Windows is Windows Vista. The online service MSN, the cable television station MSNBC and the Microsoft online magazine Slate are all part of this division. (Slate was acquired by The Washington Post on December 21, 2004.) At the end of 1997, Microsoft acquired Hotmail, the most popular webmail service, which it rebranded as &quot;MSN Hotmail&quot;. In 1999, Microsoft introduced MSN Messenger, an instant messaging client, to compete with the popular AOL Instant Messenger. Along with Windows Vista, MSN Messenger became Windows Live Messenger.

Microsoft Visual Studio is the company&apos;s set of programming tools and compilers. The software product is GUI-oriented and links easily with the Windows APIs, but must be specially configured if used with non-Microsoft libraries. The current version is Visual Studio 2008. The previous version, Visual Studio 2005 was a major improvement over its predecessor, Visual Studio.Net 2003, named after the .NET initiative, a Microsoft marketing initiative covering a number of technologies. Microsoft&apos;s definition of .NET continues to evolve. As of 2004, .NET aims to ease the development of Microsoft Windows-based applications that use the Internet, by deploying a new Microsoft communications system, Indigo (now renamed Windows Communication Foundation). This is intended to address some issues previously introduced by Microsoft&apos;s DLL design, which made it difficult, even impossible in some situations, to manage, install multiple versions of complex software packages on the same system (see DLL-hell), and provide a more consistent development platform for all Windows applications (see Common Language Infrastructure). In addition, the Company established a set of certification programs to recognize individuals who have expertise in its software and solutions. Similar to offerings from Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Novell, IBM, and Oracle Corporation, these tests are designed to identify a minimal set of proficiencies in a specific role; this includes developers (&quot;Microsoft Certified Solution Developer&quot;), system/network analysts (&quot;Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer&quot;), trainers (&quot;Microsoft Certified Trainers&quot;) and administrators (&quot;Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Certified Database Administrator&quot;).

Microsoft offers a suite of server software, entitled Windows Server System. Windows Server 2003, an operating system for network servers, is the core of the Windows Server System line. Another server product, Systems Management Server, is a collection of tools providing remote-control abilities, patch management, software distribution and a hardware/software inventory. Other server products include:
* Microsoft SQL Server, a relational database management system;
* Microsoft Exchange Server, for certain business-oriented e-mail features;
* Small Business Server, for messaging and other small business-oriented features; and
* Microsoft BizTalk Server, for employee integration assistance and other functions.

<h2> Business Division </h2>

<internal id="13752112">Front entrance to building 17 on the main campus of the company&apos;s Redmond campus.</internal>

The Microsoft Business Division produces Microsoft Office, which is the company&apos;s line of office software. The software product includes Word (a word processor), Access (a personal relational database application), Excel (a spreadsheet program), Outlook (Windows-only groupware, frequently used with Exchange Server), PowerPoint (presentation software), and Publisher (desktop publishing software). A number of other products were added later with the release of Office 2003 including Visio, Project, MapPoint, InfoPath and OneNote.

The division focuses on developing financial and business management software for companies. These products include products formerly produced by the Business Solutions Group, which was created in April 2001 with the acquisition of Great Plains. Subsequently, Navision was acquired to provide a similar entry into the European market, resulting in the planned release of Microsoft Dynamics NAV in 2006. The group markets Axapta and Solomon, catering to similar markets, which is scheduled to be combined with the Navision and Great Plains lines into a common platform called Microsoft Dynamics.

<h2> Entertainment and Devices Division </h2>

<internal id="13752123">The Xbox 360, Microsoft&apos;s second system in the gaming console market.</internal>

Microsoft has attempted to expand the Windows brand into many other markets, with products such as Windows CE for PDAs and its &quot;Windows-powered&quot; Smartphone products. Microsoft initially entered the mobile market through Windows CE for handheld devices, which today has developed into Windows Mobile 6. The focus of the operating system is on devices where the OS may not directly be visible to the end user, in particular, appliances and cars. The company produces MSN TV, formerly WebTV, a television-based Internet appliance. Microsoft used to sell a set-top Digital Video Recorder (DVR) called the UltimateTV, which allowed users to record up to 35 hours of television programming from a direct-to-home satellite television provider DirecTV. This was the main competition in the UK for British Sky Broadcasting&apos;s (BSkyB) SKY + service, owned by Rupert Murdoch. UltimateTV has since been discontinued, with DirecTV instead opting to market DVRs from TiVo Inc. before later switching to their own DVR brand.

Microsoft sells computer games that run on Windows PCs, including titles such as Age of Empires, Halo and the Microsoft Flight Simulator series. It produces a line of reference works that include encyclopedias and atlases, under the name Encarta. Microsoft Zone hosts free premium and retail games where players can compete against each other and in tournaments.

Microsoft has often been described as having a developer-centric business culture. A great deal of time and money is spent each year on recruiting young university-trained software developers and on keeping them in the company. For example, while many software companies often place an entry-level software developer in a cubicle desk within a large office space filled with other cubicles, Microsoft assigns a private or semiprivate closed office to every developer or pair of developers. In addition, key decision makers at every level are either developers or former developers. In a sense, the software developers at Microsoft are considered the &quot;stars&quot; of the company in the same way that the sales staff at IBM are considered the &quot;stars&quot; of their company.

Within Microsoft the expression &quot;eating our own dog food&quot; is used to describe the policy of using the latest Microsoft products inside the company in an effort to test them in &quot;real-world&quot; situations. Only prerelease and beta versions of products are considered dog food.   CNET News.com Staff

The majority of criticism has been for its business tactics, often described with the motto &quot;embrace, extend and extinguish&quot;.

    Microsoft has been called a &quot;velvet sweatshop&quot; in reference to allegations of the company working its employees to the point where it might be bad for their health. The first instance of &quot;velvet sweatshop&quot; in reference to Microsoft originated from a Seattle Times article in 1989, and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft&apos;s own employees.

Free software proponents point to the company&apos;s joining of the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA) as a cause of concern. A group of companies that seek to implement an initiative called Trusted Computing (which is claimed to set out to increase security and privacy in a user&apos;s computer), the TCPA is decried by critics as a means to allow software developers to enforce any sort of restriction they wish over their software.

Advocates of free software also take issue with Microsoft&apos;s promotion of Digital Rights Management (DRM) and total cost of ownership (TCO) comparisons with its &quot;Get the facts&quot; campaign. Digital Rights Management is a technology that allows content providers to impose restrictions on the methods by which their products are used on consumer hardware; and subsequently, detractors contend that such technology is an infringement on fair use and other rights, especially given that it inhibits legal activities such as re-mixing or reproduction of material for use in slide shows.
